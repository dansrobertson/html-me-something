    <p>For a few years of my life I worked at a college as a janitor in the northeast. It was a good experience, although,
        sometimes I felt like I was smarter than the people that went or worked there. This one time a member of 
        the facility, I guess from the math department, wrote half an equation on a blackboard out in the
        main corridor. I was there mopping the floor late one night and noticed it. After looking over it for a while I 
        was somehow able to figure it out. Anyway, Ben Affleck was my best friend at the time and we had some wicked
        adventures. "How about them apples?" <img src="math.png" alt="Math board" height="150" width="150"></p>
    
    <p2 class="wildebeest">One time I was living out in the African safari, this is when I was a bit younger, just a small child. Anyway, I was
        hiking through the bottom of a big gorge, tall, tall cliffs on both sides, when I stopped to take a break in the
        shade. Then there was this weird rumbling and the ground was kind of shaking and I thought it might be an earthquake.
        When I looked up I saw a huge herd of wildebeest charging down the slope into the gorge, I guess they got spooked by
        some hyenas. I thought I was going to die clinging on the tree branch above the stampede, but right before it broke my
        dad came charging in and pulled me out and threw me to safety. He had to climb a different way to get out, and he 
        almost made it to my uncle that was reaching out to help him but i guess he just couldn't hold on and he feel 
        under the hooves of all those beasts. <img src="wildebeest.png" alt="Wildebeest" height="150" width="150"> </p2>
